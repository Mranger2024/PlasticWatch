# **App Name**: Plastic Watch

## Core Features:

- Image Upload & Geolocation: Users upload 2-3 images of plastic waste (company logo, recycling info) and the app automatically captures GPS coordinates, beach name, and timestamp. A unique ID is assigned to the product.
- Stats Dashboard: The homepage displays a live dashboard showing total plastics documented, top contributors, companies ranked by pollution share, and interactive maps.
- Company Ranking: Displays companies ranked by the number of plastic items found, using visual cues like badges or colors to denote pollution levels.
- Beach Impact Visualization: Visualizes which beaches are most affected by plastic waste, broken down by company.
- User Contribution Tracker: Logged-in users can view their personal contribution stats and a map of their uploads.
- Automated Data Tagging: Use a tool to examine new image submissions and automatically pre-tag them with the brand/manufacturer based on the image. It presents these automatic suggestions to admins for approval and adjustment.
- Admin Classification Interface: An admin interface allows for classifying unclassified product IDs with company/brand, manufacturer, and plastic type.

- Use clean, minimalist vector icons representing different types of plastic, companies, and beach locations.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout with ample whitespace to ensure readability and a professional aesthetic.
